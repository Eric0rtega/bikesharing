# Citibike Bikesharing Data & Visualizations

[Link to Citibike Data Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/eric2792#!/vizhome/CitibikeDataStory_16104945204870/CitiBikeData "Citibike Dashboard")

# In this project we took a raw CSV data file, read it into a Python notebook using Jupyter Notebooks. Read through and displayed the data as a data frame, edited column values based on their types. We then took the newly edited dataframe and exported it as a new CSV file to begin with our analysis and visualizations in Tableau.

Below you will find each image and a description:

## Summary
If I would create a better dashboard I would have to do so by making it more informative. I think a CEO or VP would like to know the pitch, the changes if any, the direction of the company and not much more. With that being said, I would like to work with data such as revenue and expenses for the company. What is coming and what is coming out to maintain a good standard of the Citibike Service.
